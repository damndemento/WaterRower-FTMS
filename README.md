# vendomniaBLE

This project is based on the **ArduRower** project from **zpukr (https://github.com/zpukr/ArduRower)**, thank you very much for your support!

I build this for my **Vendomnia Rower** to add BLE / FTMS support to the rower. I used a cheap **esp32lolin clone** for this project.
It should work with **Coxswain** on Android devices and with other apps that support the **FTMS** (FiTness Machine Service) protocol.
